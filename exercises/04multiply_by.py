# Write a method called `multiply_by` that takes a number and
# array, and returns the array of numbers multiplied by that number.
#
# You'll want to apply your fundamental programming knowledge here.
# What are the pieces to this problem? You'll need to define a method,
# need a return statement, need a for loop to iterate over the array.
#
# Example method call:
#
# multiply_by([1, 2, 3], 5)
#
# > [5, 10, 15]


def multiply_by(list, num):
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(list):
        product = list[i] * num
        result.append(product)
        i+=1
    print(result)

multiply_by([1,2,3], 5)
