# Write a function called `multiply_by` that takes a list and
# a number, and returns the list of numbers multiplied by that number.
#
# You'll want to apply your fundamental programming knowledge here.
# What are the pieces to this problem? You'll need to define a function,
# need a return statement, need a for loop to iterate over the array.
#
# Example function call:
#
# multiply_by([1, 2, 3], 5)
#
# > [5, 10, 15]

def multiply_by(nums, operator):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] = nums[i] * operator
    
    return nums

print(multiply_by([1, 2, 3], 5))
