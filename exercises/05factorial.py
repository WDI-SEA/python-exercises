# Write a method to compute the `factorial` of a number.
# Given a whole number n, a factorial is the product of all
# whole numbers from 1 to n.
# 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
#
# Example method call
#
# factorial(5)
#
# > 120

  result = 1
  for i in range(result, (number + 1)):
      result = result * i
  return result
